If a large number of councils choose to opt out of the reform process, the impact on scale benefits could include a reduction in the potential to achieve operating, capital, and financial efficiencies; compromised economic viability of the reforms; some communities missing out on the benefits of reforms, especially those with a lower ratepaying base; and the creation of a patchwork quilt of three waters owners and managers within a catchment. This is, in fact, the status quo. Given that local government and councils have already accepted that there is a compelling case for change, now that we have the data analysis and evidence to support that view, it would be useful for councils to understand the information that is being released today in order to help them make their decision.

We've known about this for decades; the Green Party has been talking about it for decades. Although there are some members in the House who've finally come on board and realised climate change is something they may need to worry about, they still don't understand how quickly we need to act and change fundamental aspects of how we live our lives in our society, how we produce food, how we get around, in order to survive this.

I know many of the steps that have been taken thus far are good steps: extending the brightline test, removing deductibility of mortgage interest. All of that will help but we have to address the housing supply issue and we have to do it in a way that is going to reduce emissions. One thing that really concerns me is that 90 percent of the housing that's been built since 2018 does not have frequent public transport near it at all. So we're building housing in the wrong places.

Well, keeping a lid on debt is not a responsible thing to do when we have record low interest rates and we have a need to increase spending to address inequality, child poverty, the housing crisis, and the climate crisis. We've got the leaders of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF; the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; and the World Bank all saying that this is a time for Governments to spend more money to address inequality, to spend more money on income support, to spend more money on infrastructure. This is not a time to worry about debt, and even the Secretary to the Treasury gave a very interesting speech earlier this week where she raised exactly this point. The right level of spending depends critically on the value of the spending initiatives and where they deliver high value for money, the appropriate level of debt will be higher.

That came about as part of the work of the select committee. I really want to acknowledge the members of that committee for hearing the voices of that incredibly diverse community. There\\'s not just one kind of disability, one kind of person who suffers from disability, and anyone who does suffer from a disability doesn\\'t always suffer from just one type of disability. These are layered issues, and this definition, which I will read out, is now expanded to include people who have, \"long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments that, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others\". This is a watershed moment in New Zealand\\'s law, because it is, for the first time, at least a step towards recognising the modern experiences of this very diverse community. Everyone across Aotearoa will know someone who\\'s impacted by this type of long-term—we can call it impairment or marginalisation. Because, actually, once we recognise that it\\'s our participation on an equal basis with others that\\'s hindered, and that that can be done through long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairment, that\\'s when we start to look at all of our laws—our education system, our housing, our roads, our system of justice—in multiple other ways beyond this bill.

And this is where we are making a change, because, currently, we cannot seize items that are necessary for the tools of trade, necessary household furniture, and for effects like your fridge and your freezer, as an example—even your clothing cannot be seized—and the goods that are seized under the warrant to seize property can be sold to help pay off your debt.

Repossession happens when there's hire purchase goods or goods listed as security under a loan contract, and if a person defaults on that loan contract and payment of it, then those goods could actually end up being repossessed. The lender can take those goods because they don't belong to the creditor. And it can also happen to the guarantors. I'll give you an example. If a car has been smashed up—and this is about a vehicle, a mobility vehicle, that was taken away—in an accident but it's subject to a credit contract and it's written off, then that can be repossessed. However, if the car is not subject to that loan, then it can't be.

So that is an important particular point that has been noted in this bill in the short eight words that have been used, but it is of significant importance.'},\n",

The full extent of that definition has not been captured in this bill, but what I\\'m leading on to is that the recommendation for the amendment by the select committee to the definition of \"disabled person\" was so that it aligns with the Human Rights Act, but also aligns with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. So the definition under the Human Rights Act is way more expansive in scope than what is encompassed under this amendment to the District Court Act.

It\\'s beyond more than someone who is just physically disabled.

It was about 17 years ago that, as the result of a birth injury, I ended up on crutches for six weeks. It was an extraordinary experience to suddenly discover how my mobility was hampered. Fifteen years later, that baby suffered a major accident. My whānau have had, over the last three years, the experience of living with a child with a major physical impairment. Now, we are lucky. We are lucky that our son has recovered his full mobility. But we are also lucky because we were in good, strong financial circumstances. We were able to cope with the need to take time off to care for our child.

The costs of caregiving for a child with disabilities are such that families often end up under severe financial strain. There is a significant percentage of children with disabilities who end up living in families who have a median wage under $30,000. That is to do with the costs of raising a disabled child. The cost of living with a disability in a society that does not fully accommodate disability at present is also that those children go on to have constraints on their lives as adults. So we are in a situation where 45 percent of disabled adults have no employment, as opposed to the 75 percent of non-disabled adults who are in employment. Thirty percent of disabled women have no educational qualifications, as opposed to 15 percent of non-disabled women. People living with disabilities are more likely to end up with mental health issues. They are more likely to be victimised through the criminal justice system—all of which is to say that while this is a small—and perfectly formed—bill, it is one which addresses a real inequity, and it's an inequity that affects a considerable number of disabled people in the sense that they are more at risk of being socio-economically disadvantaged and ending up in a situation where they may, in fact, have debts they cannot repay.\"},\n",

The proposed change that the member is bringing today is to include unlawful taking within that definition. Now, the reason I think that this is problematic is that the criminal law ranks offences both on scale of the acts that have been committed and, secondly, on the intent or mens rea.

I'd suggest there are two ways of addressing that; one, which the member and the chair of the Justice Committee have both addressed, is other penalties, so I suspect that one of the problems the member is trying to address is the scale of the penalty, but there may already be a solution to that. As the member herself has referenced, there are other sections within the Crimes Act that police can also charge under, including section 307A, threats of harm to people or property; section 306, threatening to kill or do grievous bodily harm; or section 193, assault with intent to injure.

What I found is this. This year, on Tuesday, 30 March, after a morning of crime, two suspects were arrested for carjacking a person at McDonald\\'s in Mount Roskill. On 4 January this year, a woman had her car carjacked at Foxton Beach. The car was written off by the offender. It was not insured, and through no fault of her own, she\\'s lost her mobility—her asset. On 6 May 2020, a carjacking occurred at the Whangārei service station with a five-week-old baby inside the vehicle at the time that it was taken. On 24 May 2017, a man was dragged from his vehicle by a suspect already on the run from police.

Then he opened his driver's door and told him to get out. The driver slammed the door and drove away. Not deterred, Dylan Brett then attempted to pull a driver from a second vehicle, but the driver resisted and the offender ran away. But the third attempt was successful. He carjacked a woman in her Nissan car in Christchurch. But, possibly like something straight out of The Goon Show, the offender drove off, leaving his co-offender running behind him.

Now, we all accept that carjacking is a pretty revolting crime. It is scary. It is often accompanied by violence. It often does lead to the damage to property. It is absolutely something on which we should be having a very hard line. But there's hard lines already. If there's one thing that I don't think this country needs, it's this House spending its time repeating the wheel, having a knee-jerk little bit of legislation that perhaps makes us feel good.

We have a definition of a thing called robbery, which has 10 years; that's theft with violence or threats of violence. Then we have this other thing called vehicle conversion, section 226 in the Crimes Act, which has the same penalty as theft, which is seven years. So how are we going to make up those three years, is, I think, the thought here. Because I think conversion in section 226  is primarily considered to be joyriding, a crime that involves taking a parked car on the street and being an idiot. Now, that's a very different thing from a carjacking. It does not, obviously, involve the same degree of harm.\"},\n",

There is absolutely no need for us to do anything else. So, let me take you through it, if you don't mind. The first point is that we have the option of co-charging other offences. So you can charge for the conversion, which is the taking without intent to permanently deprive—because this is, for example, someone who is going to junk the car at the end of the ride and run—we can then charge for any violence. So violence charges start with a penalty of one year for common assault and it rises upward from there.

So you can still charge an assault even if there is only a threat of violence. Then if you've got a worse assault, you can have, for example, the charge of injuring with intent. So when Ms McKee was talking about the poor woman who was hauled from her car and damaged by the seatbelt, it seems to me that is an obvious case of injuring with intent, which carries a sentence of I think it's around five years, from memory. If then there has been an occasion when during that carjacking the driver or the baby, in the example that we were given, is confined in that car deliberately, however brief that might be, that is the offence of kidnapping. Even a brief deprivation of liberty is kidnapping. Police are adept at charging it. Kidnapping carries the penalty of 14 years.\"},\n",

Before I go into the specifics of the bill, what I want to do, though, is just talk about the broader context in terms of workplace drug-testing and what it actually aims to achieve, and then think about whether this bill actually takes us further in that direction. If you go to Employment New Zealand\\'s website and you type in \"drug testing\", you come up with their \"Drugs, alcohol and work\" page, and one of the key points it emphasises there is that, under law, both employers and employees have a duty to ensure that their workplace is safe. Then they go on to talk about using drugs and alcohol can lead to employee impairment at work, and they talk about some of the effects of impairment: poor concentration, carelessness, risk-taking behaviour, and errors in judgment. Then they also talk about how alcohol and drug use not only affects work performance and productivity, but you end up with higher rates of injury, fatalities, and absenteeism. So the key function of testing for drugs at work is to make sure that we\\'ve got a safe workplace, but it comes down to the impairment factor on that and, basically, the fact that that impairment then can go on and compromise the safety of the employee themselves, their fellow workers, and members of the general public.

Generally, an employer can only really ask an employee to have alcohol or drug testing if it's a condition of their appointment and if it's in the employment agreement or if it's a workplace policy. So, basically, Employment New Zealand recommends that employers thinking about drug testing their employees seek legal advice because, basically, what you've got to weigh up are the risks and benefits versus the privacy and invasion of privacy for individual employees. Basically, if they're thinking about it, why they might be doing it is to protect the safety of employees or the general public—for example, if the employee works in a safety-sensitive area or if their work directly impacts the safety of others, other colleagues or members of the public—and you've also got to balance that requirement about safety versus not creating unreasonable intrusion into the privacy of employees. \"},\n",

So the options there are you can look at pre-employment tests, random drug-testing, testing on suspicion of use, or after you've had a near miss or an accident. I think looking at safety-sensitive workplaces, pre-employment testing often can give a signal from the employer to the employee that they're serious about managing the impacts of alcohol and drug risk within the workplace and so putting something in the job vacancy gives that signal to that potential employee that the employer is very concerned about managing those risks. \"},\n",

So that's about research, testing, etc. But the issue we've got is that urine is only one of those elements that can be tested for in workplace drug-testing.

So, basically, the question is: what proportion of behaviour is going to be displaced if you end up with taking people away from using synthetic urine and moving on to detox products?

So the question is: if we're then, again, banning synthetic urine products, what does that do about that whole focus in the employment situation around impairment and the culture of the workplace where the workers are identifying impairment among themselves or among others? Because I think it's really important that we create that culture in the workplace that doesn't focus just on a single drug test, but it focuses on having that shared employer-employee relationship, focusing on impairment and identifying the reasons for impairment in the workplace that can lead to injury or accident. In that situation, there's a lot of other factors that may not be picked up by particular urine testing or other drug testing.

Yet we\\'ve then not then gone back and focused on that relationship between the employer and the employee and creating a positive environment where we can actually really focus on the particular sources of impairment that we get in the workplace. So, basically, I think what we need to be doing is stepping back and saying, \"What is our broader approach to safety in the workplace?\", and then focusing on those factors in addition to drug impairment, alcohol, fatigue, and working out how we work together to identify where those systems are.'},\n",

Secondly, it looks as if there haven't been any employment cases in New Zealand relating to this particular issue.

As my colleague who has just taken her seat has said, it's often also not very fair.

There's a couple of issues that I have with that, because I actually see that the key problem is actually impairment at work. I think what we're all trying to achieve is a safe workplace, and a safe workplace is going to be achieved by identifying impairment rather than using testing, which is significantly flawed, and experts do agree in many situations that they are significantly flawed in detecting drugs at a level which cause impairment.

So, for me, banning synthetic urine won't solve the problem. The problem is actually easily gamed, if you like, by the user by, for example, just using urine from a producer, and I actually am surrounded by, I hope, suppliers of healthy urine.
