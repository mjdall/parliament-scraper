      "text": "I rise on behalf of the National Party to support this bill, the Gas (Information Disclosure and Penalties) Amendment Bill. This bill amends the Gas Act 1992 to provide for enhanced information disclosure requirements for the gas market and to ensure the settings around enforcement and penalties are suitably robust. It does not make substantive changes in and of itself, but it amends the framework to expand the scope of regulation-making powers. A number of the changes require gas industry participants to report forecasts of supply and demand of gas reserves. This is in response to the 2018 Pohokura outage, but it also can be linked to the Government's decision to ban offshore oil and gas exploration.\nNational supports more transparent disclosure around current, pending, or possible gas outages, but we need to remember why we're here. This law is needed because New Zealand is fast entering a gas supply crisis. We heard earlier today during question time about the amount of Indonesian coal that New Zealand is currently importing, which was about 1.1 million tonnes last year and is on track to be significantly more than that this year. That is a direct correlation to the decision by the Labour Party, in the last term, to prohibit the further exploration of gasfields.\nThis bill does allow New Zealand to understand the situation that Labour has put us in. When Labour banned gas, Minister Woods said there was nothing to be concerned about: we have 100,000 square kilometres of exploration already permitted, we have permits that go out 30 years. She said the sky isn't falling in. What she didn't say is that gas doesn't come out of the ground by magic. Businesses need to invest, businesses need confidence to invest significant resources into both the exploration and the extraction of gas. It is estimated we need $100 million investment per year just to keep the production levels that we have. This has dried up, and we've seen gas production fall 40 percent in three years. It has already result in job losses at Methanex, in timber mills, and New Zealand Steel have reduced production. Huntly is burning four times as much coal. Greenhouse gas emissions are up. Wholesale electricity prices are four times higher than what we had in 2018.\nThat is an important issue for low-income or fixed-income families. The price of electricity is a significant cost on households around the country, and particularly in times when it's cold, as in now, i.e., in winter. Many families in New Zealand have fixed incomes and they have a set amount they can spend on electricity, they have a set amount they can spend on food, set amount they can spend on rents. Unfortunately, we are seeing unintended consequences from what you might say are well-meaning policies by this Government but policies that don't take into account the real, practical implications of decisions that they make.\nWe are seeing that in the housing market with the price of houses skyrocketing and the price of rents increasing $100 per week, and we're seeing this in the electricity market with the price of electricity increasing significantly, having a direct impact on families and on businesses. It's certainly something that I've heard in my electorate, where businesses have had to reduce production of milling timber, for example, because of the cost of electricity on the spot market.\nThe other thing is the alternative sources of energy are important in the balance of the mix provided the electricity market can rely on. I note that just in the last couple of days, there was a very significant storm in Central Otago which knocked down power poles and meant households, in a big storm, including significant snowfall, weren't able to heat their homes for well over a day and night in some instances.\nSo the supply of energy to our homes and our businesses is a matter of significant importance, and, unfortunately, Labour has taken an ideological approach to reducing the supply of gas without looking at what is going to replace it and having a replacement strategy in place and actually generating electricity for our market. The direct implication we're seeing is that we are now importing significantly more dirty Indonesian coal, as it's often called, than we were only two years ago. I will conclude my comments there.",

I'd like to start by reassuring the member on the other side of the House that this Government is indeed doing a lot to invest in the future, which is renewable. I'd like to invite the member to come to the wonderful part of the world that is South Taranaki and visit the Kapuni solar plant and the Waipipi wind farm. We don't just grow milk but we grow energy. We're really proud of that investment, and we are really, really pleased to see that it isn't all about a narrow idea of coal.\nIt isn't just Kapuni and Waipipi but the significant investment that our world-leading energy sector is making in greengas. Gas is part of the future, but it's green.\nI'd like to take a moment to acknowledge those who made submissions to the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee. As I read through them, I noted that they were thoughtful and helpful. The sector engaged in the issues that had been highlighted by the concerns around the outages with natural gas, and it was a piece written by Firstgas that reminded us why these changes have been welcomed. Firstgas talked about consistent and timely information about production outages meaning that efficiencies for maintenance and planning and outages could be greater. So it is really great to have had the thoughtful engagement from the sector about how to make sure that the gas part of the energy sector is best looked after.\nThere were some changes made in select committee as a result of submissions, and the recommended change\u2014it was an important one\u2014will ensure that a failure of an industry participant to follow a Gas Rulings Panel order will continue to carry a criminal penalty. The down flow and the impact on so many consumers when things go wrong has been highlighted by members on the other side of the House, and it is important that everyone involved in the industry plays their part to ensure that our energy provision in electricity is done in a manner that is not harmful to those who are using it.\nIt will help to ensure that the appropriate incentives are in place for the industry to comply with the orders from the Gas Rulings Panel. This bill represents a step forward in improving the information that highlights the risk of critical gas shortages or the potential for significant price impacts, and the impacts that have been highlighted for industries when it's released to the market, which should improve the management of the situation.\nI'd just like to acknowledge again the progressive energy industry that is in Taranaki. The future is bright and it's lit by green gas and solar and wind. The future is definitely in the energy province, as this Government proudly stands with the sector to take up these significant challenges to decarbonise, and this bill does help with the small but important role that gas currently plays in the electricity market.\nI think the way that the sector engaged so sincerely with the challenges presented by the failures in the market to date in coming up with solutions which are complex shows the strength of the relationship between this Government and the energy sector. We've had tough times, but there is a commitment to collaborate and build a world-class energy centre, and I feel a great deal of satisfaction when I go past Waipipi and look at those blades in the wind\u2014there's some advantages to being on the west coast of Taranaki. We look forward to our bright, green energy future, and, of course, this is why I am very, very happy to commend this bill to the House.",

I just want to thank the member before me, Angela Roberts, who spoke about her invitation to New Plymouth\u2014I will happily take that. It's a beautiful part of the country, and it's doing a lot of good work in just transition, which we should all be proud of.\nThe bill we're talking about at the moment will amend the Gas Act of 1992. The Act is the principal piece of legislation that governs the gas industry in New Zealand. The gas industry is co-regulated by the Government and the approved industry body, the Gas Industry Company (GIC). The original Act empowers the making of a wide range of regulations relating to matters that govern the gas industry; however, recent natural gas supply outages have raised concerns about the lack of transparency of information in the gas market. The outages include those at the Pohokura production station in 2018, as well as planned outages at other stations. Outages at gas production stations can affect gas availability and prices, as we have seen in the past. They also affect the electricity market, which uses gas for thermal electricity generation, which acts as a backup electricity supply during periods of high demand when limited electricity storage is available. For example, the outage, as I mentioned, in 2018 led to increased prices for many consumers during the spring of 2018. Some power companies even reported receiving only minimal information about how long the disruption was expected to last. The outage also reportedly cost its main customer around $2 million a day in lost revenue\u2014$2 million a day.\nThe bill as proposed now, which has gone through the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee, would expand the scope of the regulation recommendation powers available to the GIC by inserting provisions enabling enhanced information disclosure about the gas market. Information able to be disclosed would be matters that may have a significant downstream impact or may contribute to the risk of critical gas shortages. These provisions would enable regulation that could apply to all industry participants and non-industry participants. They will not apply to domestic consumers, and the types of information that might be required to be provided or disclosed are broad and non-exhaustive.\nThe bill would also amend the penalties regime under the Act for regulation or rules breached by industry and non-industry participants. It would increase the $20,000 civil pecuniary penalty limit for gas ruling panel orders to $200,000, so that's a tenfold increase. It would also replace the current criminal penalty for non-industry participants with a civil pecuniary penalty. This aims to make the penalties for industry participants and non-industry participants more aligned so it brings everybody on to the same playing field.\nNow, yesterday, when I was hearing members on both sides of the House talking about it, there were members of the select committee who talked about receiving a significant number of submissions, which has led to, I guess, a few different changes being made through the select committee process. One of them was that the recommended change will ensure that a failure of an industry participant to follow a gas ruling panel will continue to carry a criminal penalty. The second one was that this will help ensure that the appropriate incentives are in place for the industry to comply with the orders from the gas rulings panel, as I have mentioned before. And thirdly, the bill represents a step forward in improving how information that may highlight risks of critical gas shortages or potential for significant price impacts is released to the market, which should improve the management of situations where critical gas shortages may occur.\nSo, overall, this bill significantly enhances the original Act of 1992, and I do want to commend the Minister Megan Woods for putting this Government bill forward, as well as the Economic Development, Science and Innovation Committee, which has spent quite a lot of time consulting with people across various communities and, I understand, communities like New Plymouth and Taranaki, where a lot of members and their constituents have fed into this consultation process. So I think it is a strong bill and it will only help with the just transition and other measures the Government is taking in the energy field across the board in New Zealand, and I would highly recommend this bill to go ahead, and just want to thank everybody who's been involved in the consultation process\u2014thank you.",

It really is topical at this moment to be talking about this issue, of course. We have significant increases in electricity prices coming down the pipeline to the homeowner very shortly as a result, in part, because we're in a dry year. But our normal dry-year winter peak is covered by gas and coal, and, unfortunately, due to circumstances in the gas industry, we don't have the gas that we would normally expect to get us through, and so the hydro companies held back water, as is the right thing to do, through the summer and autumn and early winter to ensure that they had enough to get us through this period. However, the costs to the homeowner are going to come home to roost, as it were, later on, in the coming weeks.\nUnfortunately, for the industry, this has already occurred. Businesses had to curtail production and, in some cases, even close because of the extremely high spot-market prices for electricity. This bill seeks to ensure that there's more information available for all players so that decisions can be made ahead of time. However, in the whole electricity and energy sector, information is power. It's also essential. Unfortunately, some of the moves that have been made by this Government have actually slowed down what would have been developing other generation sources, because the industry doesn't have the confidence to invest money in what are very long-term investments. They can't invest money in gas exploration or refurbishment of their wells if they think that they're going to be cancelled in five or six years, and that's unfortunately the uncertainty that we're facing right now.\nThere's $100 million a year required in the maintenance of these gasfields to keep the gas flowing. Unfortunately, that cash has not arrived\u2014not all of it, anyway\u2014and that is why the dry-year issue that we've had, as well as the shortage of gas, has driven the price much higher than it would have otherwise been, and we're all going to pay the price for that. Some people have already paid that price by losing their jobs. So these things have real impacts. Something like an oil and a gas ban has drained the confidence of the industry, so this bill is a step to try and sort this out, to some extent. Although, this has not led to the issues we've had today, a lack of information. It was actually a lack of investment. But the National Party is here to help bail the Government out, because, actually, New Zealanders need our help, and we're here to help.\nI think it's been quite extraordinary, some of the things I've heard in the earlier speeches yesterday on this topic.

      "text": "I move, That the House take note of the report of Zero Suicide Aotearoa.\nAnd I say that it is a distinct privilege, as Minister of Health, to lead off this, I think, important and difficult debate on this topic. It's important because the reality is, in New Zealand, we have a major challenge when it comes to the incidence of suicide. In 2019, 680 people died by suicide in New Zealand. I think the statistics show that there is a distinct profile to those who die by suicide in New Zealand. We see more young men, more M\u0101ori, more folks from the rural sector dying by suicide. The rates for 15- to 19-year-olds who have died by suicide has increased considerably in the last three years. It's a difficult debate, too, because as a country, as a people, like most countries around the world, we are not used to talking about suicide. We're not used to discussing it. In fact, over time, we've put many restrictions in place that have prevented public discussion and debate about suicide. So the way this House conducts itself, the way this House discusses this important and difficult topic will be a lead for the rest of the country.\nIt is also undoubtedly difficult because, unquestionably, our minds turn to those people we know who have died by suicide and we think of them and we think of the families who have been left bereft by that loss. So let's make this debate in honour of them. Our minds also turn to those who we know who have attempted suicide, and this is a moment that we can hold them just a little closer in our hearts.\nI want to acknowledge the Cross-Party Parliamentary Mental Health and Addiction Wellbeing Group. That was a recommendation from the He Ara Oranga report. I want to thank those members on all sides of the House who have volunteered for the task of participating in that group\u2014and I might add, just as I look around the House and I look at the report, that includes former members of this House and I acknowledge Jenny Marcroft, as well, who has contributed to those discussions in that group and to this report. As I say, thank you for taking on that task and for creating a forum in which all members of this House, regardless of the party, can have a discussion about these important issues, about the sort of policy that we think Governments of whatever stripe should be employing as we deal with the challenge ahead of us.\nI want to acknowledge the report that has been produced: Zero Suicide Aotearoa. I want to particularly acknowledge the ambition that is represented in the title of the report: zero suicide. When the Government came to consider the report of He Ara Oranga, and particularly their recommendation that said that we should set a target for the reduction in the number of suicides. That was a fiercely debated recommendation and, in the end, the Government settled on a position of not accepting that recommendation. We didn't accept that it was right to set a target. If, as the report argues, the proposition is that suicide is preventable\u2014if we accept suicide is preventable\u2014then no suicide is acceptable. That's the premise on which this Government has developed its policy, and I believe that is a sentiment that this House also accepts in accordance with the report.\nAs the report also acknowledges, suicide is complex. The pathways to suicide are complex and differ between different population groups. Preventing suicide is complex. There are three responses that we typically turn to, at least in Government and in Parliament, and I'll go quickly through each of those. Obviously, we want good mental health services. Questions of access and availability of services, and services for the full range of mental unwellness are important\u2014so services to deal with mild conditions, anxieties, mild depression to the deeply unwell psychiatric and psychotic conditions. We have to have services that that are available to everybody, regardless of the level of unwellness.\nThe reality is, and this is no reflection on any party in this House at any time in this country's history, but I think if we reflect on it, we will accept that mental health, whether an area of health investment or Government investment generally, has been the poor cousin of our general health services for a long, long time. I think we are more enlightened now. We are better at talking about mental unwellness. We are better at talking about what it means to have better mental health and better mental wellbeing. But the reality is, given what we now know and given what we now observe and what we have experienced along with many families over many generations, there is now no excuse to neglect our services and facilities that are there to look after those who are mentally unwell and in mental distress.\nThe measures that this Government has taken in the time it has been in office includes adding leadership in this area. We've established the Mental Health and Wellbeing Commission, which provides advocacy, but also monitoring and oversight. We've established the Suicide Prevention Office that now has a $40 million budget just for programmes for prevention and postvention, and is commissioning those programmes right now. It's also got the job of reviewing the processes for investigating suicide, because we know many families are distressed by the way sometimes district health boards handle it, by the way the police sometimes handle deaths by suicide, and by the way the Coroner's Court handles it. I think we all agree we can do better to assist families who are left bereft.\nThere's also the services, and one of the principal investments that this Government has made is in primary healthcare and addiction. Through the access and choice programme, we've added 520 fulltime-equivalent roles at the front line to deal with those with mild to moderate mental health conditions. Just in the month of May alone this year, more than 20,000 sessions were offered to New Zealanders who are in that position. We currently have a population coverage of those services of about 1.4 million, and over the next two years we'll add that and increase it to about 3.7 million. We've put more investment in youth services and services for our rainbow community and for children at school and out of school. And of course, we are investing and upgrading our acute facilities. We have more to do in providing spaces in the community where there is a greater and better peer support, and we're piloting initiatives in that regard.\nOutside of services, there is then suicide prevention strategies and plans. I note two things from the report\u2014observations that the report makes. One is that countries with nationwide and comprehensive suicide prevention strategies demonstrate that they have a much better chance of reducing the incidence of suicide, although the report also notes the Scottish experience is that the path to doing that can be somewhat volatile. Then, of course, the report also notes it is possible for some well-intentioned programmes to actually do harm. So we have to be careful about what we support, what we invest in, and what we do.\nThe third element that we have to consider is striving for wellbeing. That goes beyond a health framework for mental health and wellbeing. It looks at the social determinants that we know affect mental health and wellbeing\u2014so things like housing, things like our health services, things like having a job, things like people's family circumstances, and whether or not there is violence and abuse. We know those things that can precipitate a sense of despair, a sense of not having hope: things like isolation, deprivation and poverty, discrimination, social insecurity, financial insecurity\u2014all of these things can lead a person to think about their place and their worth.\nWe have the benefit in New Zealand of something very special and it is our national lodestar. It's the Treaty of Waitangi. The ambition and the dream of the Treaty was a country at peace with itself: two peoples coming together, respecting each other, being able to live their culture, their identity, their lives. That's what the Treaty represents. Now, we've completely failed to live up to that up until more recently, and we're now striving to fulfil that dream. But if we see the Treaty as our lodestar on health issues, on wellbeing issues, and on mental health issues, a nation that respects each other, a nation that welcomes each other, a nation that forges ahead in partnership, a nation that cares about its people and cares about each other\u2014that sets us up for a country that is well and truly at peace with itself.",

Every person listening and watching from their houses and other places around New Zealand will also have their stories of being bereaved by suicide. The suicide statistics in New Zealand are confronting. Sadly, we lost provisionally 654 Kiwis last year. And what's confronting is the statistics that sit behind that: 150,000 Kiwis every year think about taking their life, 50,000 Kiwis make a suicide plan, 20,000 Kiwis attempt to take their own life. These are the harsh truths behind suicide in New Zealand, yet there is no reason why New Zealand can't have one of the lowest suicide rates in the world. There's no reason why we can't have one of the highest rates of mental wellbeing in the world. And one of those contributing factors to that solution will be political will, and that's what we are debating here today.\nI stand here today as the National Party's first mental health spokesperson, and recently I've become National's first suicide prevention spokesperson. I want to acknowledge our National Party leader, the Hon Judith Collins, who asked me to take that spokesperson role. I want to acknowledge all the MPs here today, people in the gallery, specifically Greg Gent, Nick Astwick, Terry Moore, Jo McCauley, and Jo Mahon. They are from Southern Cross. Through their philanthropic funding, they funded the Zero Suicide Aotearoa report that we are debating today and funded the launch that we are hosting today after the debate, and I want to thank them for that. I also want to thank all of those who have tuned in from around New Zealand. I thank you for taking an interest and being on this journey with us. Can I thank Platform Trust, who have been the secretariat for the mental health cross-party group, Barbara Disley and, formerly, Marion Blake, and just to acknowledge the huge work of Marion Blake in driving this report forward. The researcher Phillipa Gaines\u2014I still remember our first Zoom call with the cross-party group. Fair to say we were chaotic, we argued, we talked over each other, we all had different views, and somehow Phillipa turned that into a report. That's hugely welcome and thank you very much for that.\nCan I also acknowledge Mark Wilson from the Mental Health Foundation, and also Shaun Robinson, the lead in their team. Mark Wilson sent through, last night, a guide to talking about suicide for politicians, which I think was very important for us. Language is important in this debate. It says, \"Know your stats; don't speculate. Remind your audience that suicide is complex; there's no single cause of suicide. Give people hope; talk about suicide prevention. Remind people that suicide is preventable. Talk about what puts people at risk and how we can address those risks. Talk about M\u0101ori suicide using a Te Ao M\u0101ori approach. Remember the people; they're not statistics, they are people we love and have value.\" Thank you very much for that, Mark.\nI want to acknowledge the cross-party members of this group. I have worked hard for this group not to be political. We want to take a bipartisan view on this cross-party group, but what I think is absolutely disgusting is Labour blocked Louisa Wall from taking a call in this debate. Louisa Wall is a founding member of the cross-party mental health group. She championed this report and worked hard on it. She has been blocked from taking a call on this debate, so National has given Louisa one of their calls\u2014one of our calls\u2014because it's important that Louisa has a call in this debate. The Labour Party is emblematic at the moment of blocking things: the inquiry at the Health Committee yesterday, bullying commentators that speak out\u2014this has to stop. They promised vulnerable New Zealanders they would make a change, and I'll leave it at that, thank you. I'd like to acknowledge Louisa; Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick; formerly David Seymour, and now Brooke van Velden for ACT; our former colleague Jenny Marcroft, who is here today\u2014welcome Jenny.\nFor me, the importance of this cross-party group is that what we have uniquely is that we can come together, we can discuss the issues, and talk about positions, and then uniquely we can go back into each of our caucuses and advocate for that position. I believe New Zealanders want us to take a long-term policy setting when dealing with the challenges for mental health, and we don't want the three-year parliamentary cycle changing things. We need to take long-term policy settings. So where we have the Zero Suicide Aotearoa report, I'm quite proud the National Party adopted this report as its suicide prevention policy for the last election. I don't say that in a partisan way, but why I say it is I challenge the other parties to do the same. How good would it be in 2023 if we turn up and our policies around suicide prevention are harmonised, and whoever gets into Government, whatever colour, there'll be the certainty and assurance of policy that will be long term and make a big difference, and not get caught up in the three-year parliamentary cycle.\nI want to take a moment to talk about the zero-suicide approach, because people get stuck on the term \"zero suicide\". This approach is less about the target and more what sits behind it. It's a continuous quality improvement process, where we look to see what works in each of the sectors. This is bigger than health. It needs to be rolled out across all of Government, because what will work for suicide prevention for a 60-year-old dairy farmer in North Canterbury is different to what will work for suicide prevention for a young teenager in South Auckland, and this is the value in a zero-suicide approach\u2014a continuous quality improvement approach that is not a one-size-fits-all. It looks to look at all the differentiations on how it can make a difference, and we know it works. It was launched in 2012 in the United States, it's been adopted in the US, the UK, and Australia. This will work, but what it's going to take is political will, and what we're talking about here today, we have representatives from each of the parties, is to debate how we are going to come together and we are going to endorse a zero-suicide approach. We're not going to play politics and say, \"Well, you set a target, you didn't meet it, you're not good enough.\" It's about what sits behind it: the process and the policy, because I firmly believe, in the 53rd Parliament, New Zealanders have spoken. They want us to work together. They want us to make a difference. They want us to put politics aside and to agree on policy that has a long-term setting.\nSo my challenge is to all the parties here today: what are we going to be doing in 2023? What are we going to be talking about for suicide prevention? How good would it be in 2023 if all the parties agreed on such an important issue like zero suicide? We would have a harmonised suicide prevention policy that we would all agree on, we would all resource, and we would give New Zealanders comfort, certainty, and assurance. Thank you, Madam Speaker.",

I want to start my contribution to this debate by acknowledging my former colleague Jenny Marcroft, who was one of the contributors on this cross-party group then representing New Zealand First. I just asked her what she would like to say during this debate were she sitting in one of these seats and she made the point that I think is worthy of highlighting\u2014that this stuff is preventable; that is the core point of this Zero Suicide report.\nThe parts of work that got us to this point as has been outlined by the Minister really kicked off with He Ara Oranga, the mental health and addiction inquiry which was published in December 2018. It made a raft of recommendations to the Government, the majority of which were accepted, particularly accepted in principle. But I think it's really important to zero in on one of the major findings of that report, which is: what causes mental ill health and, at the pointy end, suicidal ideation in Aotearoa New Zealand? What it effectively did was canvass the swathes of contemporary research and the experience of those domestically in Aotearoa to surmise that we all are born into the world with different genetics from our parents and our grandparents and the experiences that are hard coded into that. But it is our environments, fundamentally, that can turn those up or turn those down\u2014that is, aggravating or mitigating factors, environmental factors, like a sense of security, a sense of identity, a sense of place, a sense of who you are, what you belong to, and where you are going.\nSo, in beginning my contribution today, I actually want to reflect on one of the most poignant things that I have ever heard about suicide prevention from Fili, who was a teenager until recently, I believe, founder of a South Auckland climate action movement called 4TK or 4 Tha Kulture. She made waves by making our Hon Leader of the Opposition a bit of a meme during the election by prompting her to respond during an election debate with, \"My husband is Samoan so 'Talofa'.\" Fili said, and I paraphrase, that suicide prevention is a stable income; suicide prevention is meaningful income; suicide prevention is a stable household; suicide prevention is a sense of community; suicide prevention is a sense of whakapapa, where you belong, where you are going.\nThis cross-party group is something that we fought long and hard for, actually, I think from inside many of our different parties and against some of the political tumult of the day. My experience is that it originated in a cross-party group on drug harm reduction, which morphed with Matt Doocey coming to the table and seeking to mould something else out of it, Louisa Wall, of course Jenny Marcroft, and, at the time, David Seymour. Our first report here, this Zero Suicide Aotearoa report was released in the middle of 2020 ahead of the election.\nWhat we see here alongside the case studies, as mentioned by Matt Doocey, is actually the experience of Scotland who adopted a similar approach several years ago now. And what they effectively showcased is that sustained effort\u2014sustained effort\u2014a plan that surpasses and exceeds the politics of the day to improve lives and to strengthen communities ensures that we can shrink those suicide numbers. Scotland introduced a Minister for mental health. I think that is something we should really seriously be considering in this place, particularly as I know it's coming up to that point in time in a Government or parliamentary term where there are some shake-ups. I would really encourage members around the Cabinet table to be contemplating and considering a Minister for Mental Health.\nThey also applied in Scotland, a public health approach, that is, to not narrow this in so far as to only look at the ambulances at the bottom of the cliff, to say somebody is experiencing a problem so we're going to pick them up. It's to say: what are the environmental causative factors that lead people to getting to that position in the first place, identifying those things that Fili put out there so eloquently\u2014the likes of housing, the likes of stable income, the likes of a sense of connection to your community. They also, importantly, and this comes up throughout our report, tackled problem drinking.\nThere are a number of specifics recommended in this report about how we can actually take a zero-suicide approach, particularly through the methodology of this cross-party group. And importantly, in this report, it notes the importance of that cross-party stewardship. And I do think it's important to echo how disappointing it is that right now our Parliament is not behaving at its best when we have monolithic blocs: one political party inside of a select committee blocking access to information that the majority of other parties want access to. That is how, in this instance, that mental health funding is being distributed\u2014or, unfortunately, not distributed\u2014to the front lines across Aotearoa.\nIt also notes that it is so important for us to monitor progress. And again, this is why that scrutiny and oversight is so important. It also states, particularly with regard to the case study on rangatahi\u2014because we know and we can see here that young M\u0101ori men, in particular, are the most at risk\u2014that there are a number of different ways that we can directly tackle the drivers of this problem. I note here it states that we can embed and enact Te Tiriti into all policy and practice to support mana motuhake accelerating this process for rangatahi within the education and health sectors. Secondly, we can urgently address the impact of socio-economic determinants of health on wh\u0101nau including poverty, alcohol, racism, housing, and unemployment. Thirdly, we can invest in what works for M\u0101ori, iwi, hap\u016b, and wh\u0101nau to invest in and fund and build communities to lead initiatives that support communities in suicide prevention and postvention. And fourthly, we can work collectively, nationally, and locally to leverage Government investment in what works for M\u0101ori.\nAgain, I think that this is perhaps something that the Government can look into should it want to\u2014to distribute that Budget 2019 funding, that $1.9 billion for mental health and addiction. Just hand the money out to those who are already doing the work on the front line. So many of them are crying out for it.\nWe also have in here the specific case study of rural mental health and there's three key factors. The first is community\u2014strengthening community. The second is targeting alcohol, particularly harmful alcohol consumption, in this country. And the third is a campaign to normalise dialogue and discussion about mental ill health and to normalise how we talk about talking somebody down from suicidal ideation.\nI also think it's really important to note just within the political context here\u2014because it's really great that we all agree that there's a problem, but we don't quite agree on what the solution is. We have some high-level agreement about the kaupapa and about the direction, but not about the amount of money that we are going to be dedicating to these things, not about the types of policy that we're going to be implementing. So here, particularly on that point around alcohol, I think it's really important that we recognise the political context we're operating in. There is currently one member's bill that, I believe, is number one on the Order Paper in the name of Louisa Wall, which would reduce harmful access to alcohol by ensuring that communities have greater say over the renewal of licences. But currently, in the members' biscuit tin there are five members' bills that would amend the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act. Four of them, effectively, increase access to alcohol in this country; one, in the bill, does not, and that is the Green Party member's bill.\nI also want to give a shout out to Corinda Taylor and the Life Matters Suicide Prevention Trust, who has been doing an immense amount of mahi for families bereaved by suicide. And it's unfortunate that we don't have the level of detail in this report to make mention of the support needed for those families bereaved. I also want to acknowledge Phillipa Gaines, the author and researcher, who, as my colleague Matt Doocey noted, very much did put up with quite rambunctious debates throughout this process.\nAnd I also just want to state in this process of making this as depoliticised as possible\u2014you know, it's admirable to a certain extent. We have agreement that there's a problem, but we, again, only have agreement over the high-level kaupapa of how we begin to address it.\nAnd I think, just to really highlight how long we've been talking about this and how long I personally have been talking about it\u2014and I don't really want to be talking about it all too much more; I'd really hope that we get on with it\u2014I want to refer to my maiden speech in November 2017, where I said, and I quote, \"Anybody paying attention to this election campaign saw that it was rather rough, and, a week before election day in my final debate, I broke down in tears. We were asked to speak on New Zealand's shameful suicide rate, particularly with regard to our youth. Another candidate took this as academic, speaking in numbers and fiscals\u2014they were abstracting the lives and loss of my friends.\"",

      "text": "Thank you, Madam Speaker. New Zealanders are watching this debate with high hopes, and I'm afraid to say that almost every person I've spoken to recently about suicide prevention, from NGOs on the front line to parents who have tragically lost children, say that the system is broken. We have an ongoing mental health crisis in this country, and with an estimated 150,000 Kiwis contemplating suicide per year\u2014that we know of\u2014the risk factor is significant. While it seems that more people are actually opening up and talking about their personal struggles, we still have a long way to go. I'm all for cross-party collaboration on this issue, because we do need to come together for the sake of those at risk, but that cannot be an excuse for ignoring faults in the system.\nPrior to entering Parliament, I worked at the Wise Group, a leading provider of mental health services through its many entities. One of those entities\u2014Le Va, for instance\u2014has a programme called LifeKeepers, which I think is a great example of a community-training approach to suicide prevention. One of the big issues with suicide in New Zealand is that many victims actually never sought help, very sadly, and it is typically those around them, friends and wh\u0101nau, who can be empowered to spot the warning signs, provide initial support, and direct them to mental health services. This is important because the Government and the NGOs can't be everywhere. I was happy to see that a number of Parliamentary Service staff actually went through the LifeKeepers programme very recently.\nI also wish to share some of the concerns that I received from various entities\u2014in particular, around the acute and crisis services provided by the DHBs. At a high level, NGOs have unfortunately spoken of a culture and attitude problem at the DHBs. People have told me that when they contact these services, they simply aren't getting sufficient information in a timely manner, nor are they receiving follow-up calls. It's likely that the DHBs need more resourcing, but with an additional $1.9 billion committed, I'm wondering why this hasn't yet been resolved. People in crisis seem to be unaware of the services available following their contact with a DHB, and if they're not sick enough, then they often get turned away. I hope that's not the general state of affairs, but that's the feedback that I've received thus far.\nAnother issue is coordination\u2014or a lack thereof. There are a range of options when it comes to mental health services, which is positive for choice. However, front-line workers tell me that it can become a bit disjointed. We've got to ensure that organisations and Government entities are working together well for the benefit of New Zealanders. I'll speak very briefly about a tragic individual case. A young woman who was known to the urgent response service of the Auckland DHB reached out to them for help. In her final phone call, she clearly communicated the urgency of her situation. She didn't get the help she needed\u2014no call back. According to her mother, as soon as she was in the public system, she went downhill. That family is now utterly heartbroken. Sadly, stories like this are all too common.\nI also want to briefly speak about our new New Zealanders. There is a mental health crisis unfolding amongst our migrant communities, where many have been split from their families, including young children, for at least a year, and in many cases significantly longer. When migrants contact me about their mental health struggles, I always suggest, obviously, that they seek professional help, and I provide as much information as I can. But in many cases, they've already gone down that road and ended up worse off. So this is just one disaster waiting to happen, and a very unnecessary one, because the Government can actually help a great deal by having a more efficient and compassionate immigration system. As a country, we need to do better for mental health.\nThis is not an issue that we can just throw money at. We need to get to the root causes of distress, enable earlier intervention, and create an efficient system from the top down. We also need to be a country where a person seeking help is empowered to make choices for their own therapy and care, rather than simply accept what's offered. ACT proposes a stand-alone nation-wide mental health commissioning agency with a clear responsibility for issuing contracts to the service provider of that person's choice, monitoring patient outcomes using evidence-based decision-making and quality of care. I'd like to lastly very much thank all of those who contributed to the Zero Suicide Aotearoa report. As parliamentarians, we need to confront the difficult issues and always work to improve the lives of New Zealanders.",

      "text": "Thank you, Mr Speaker. I stand today to talk on a topic that most people try to avoid. It's not that society doesn't care about suicide and the effects it has on our communities; it's that many just don't know what to say. I believe as a country we have become far better at talking about these issues. Only a few years ago, it would have been unheard of to be having a debate like this. Suicide was a word that made people feel shame. It was a topic not many people understood. Now, thanks to people like John Kirwan and Mike King and countless more figures in our communities and across this country, we have a better understanding of how mental illness affects people, and hopefully we've been able to get the message out that there is no shame in asking for help.\nI am proud of the fact that we have been able to have cross-party discussions around this issue. The purpose of these discussions was to set a future direction of mental health and addiction wellbeing in New Zealand. The decisions that came from this seemed promising. If implemented, it looked like we would be heading in the right direction. It's sad to say that despite $1.9 billion being allocated to ease the burden on our struggling system, we seem to be stuck with the same issues from years before. This shows that there is still a lot more work for us to do.\nIn 2019, we lost 685 New Zealanders to suicide. In 2020, we did not do much better, with a drop of only 31. We still lost a further 654 of our people. I can't speak for everyone on this\u2014how these people get to be in a place where they felt this was their only option. But I can speak from experience of feeling like the world would be better off without me in it. There have been moments in life where the world seemed so complicated, that nobody understood me, and I wasn't worth being understood. There were times I was sad and could not even tell you why I was sad. I think those were the worst times, because if you can pinpoint why, you can solve it, right?\nI just want to say it's OK to not be OK. Just because you don't understand and can't explain what it is doesn't make it any less. What is not OK is that we've gotten ourselves to the point where we are only funding people in crisis, which means people are waiting far longer than they should to get the help they need. Every New Zealander we lose impacts many people from parents, children, friends, wider family members, and our communities.\nThese discussions on suicide prevention have been a great start. Now we must move forward and start putting the plan into action. I look forward to future discussions on how we can work together to make this happen. I would like to acknowledge that there are many families in New Zealand right now struggling to navigate our system. I would also like to thank all the hard-working people who work within our mental health and addiction space. I hope we can get together and get you the tools you need to help our most vulnerable.",

      "text": "E Te Paati M\u0101ori supports the imperative to work together cross-party, cross agency, cross community to end the devastation of suicide in Aotearoa. We support the recommendations of this report, which flow out of the 2020 Te Mauri report, \"te p\u016brongo m\u014d te mate whakamomori o te rangatahi\", developed by many of our leading tangata w'enua hauora experts as part of the Ng\u0101 Pou Araw'enua. In particular, we acknowledge the recommendations to embed and enact Te Tiriti into all policy, urgently address the impact of socio-economic determinants on the health of wh\u0101nau, invest in what works for M\u0101ori iwi, hap\u016b, and w'anau. Te Paati M\u0101ori's policy has called for the establishment of a kaupapa M\u0101ori mental health service and the independent M\u0101ori health funding authority to take full control of the way mental health services are designed and developed and implemented by M\u0101ori, for M\u0101ori, with M\u0101ori.\nMental health in Aotearoa has a siloed approach to oranga for our people, and it hasn't worked. W'anau Ora is the M\u0101ori mental health strategy, but it is more than that. It's a complete wellbeing strategy, and must be valued as such. We must focus on holistic wellbeing and its determinants, rather than continuing with piecemeal and, sadly, uncoordinated approaches. Aotearoa has some of the highest suicide rates in the developed world, as we have heard, and it is a great indictment on this nation. M\u0101ori have, sadly, suffered under these systemic conditions, which perpetuate shame. The rates for M\u0101ori are horrific. They are higher than any other ethnic group in Aotearoa and are concentrated among our rangatahi. The general suicide rate in 2017-18 was 13.67 deaths per 100,000 population. Shockingly, the rate for M\u0101ori rose from 23.7 percent to a rate of 28.23 in 2018-19. I share these stats so that our w'anau at home understand the increasing impact that we're dealing with. Rangatahi and our takat\u0101pui w'anau are particularly at risk compared to any other group. Suicide was the second leading cause of premature death for M\u0101ori t\u0101ne.\nWe are here today. We have survived today despite centuries of colonisation and poverty; displacement from our natural inhabitants, our natural indigenous wellbeing; and decades of colonisation, which has entrenched inequities, displacement, and the breakdown of community and social support systems. We know that many of our w'anau, such as our t\u0101ne and takat\u0101pui rangatahi, are at the intersection of this suffering and, therefore, the sharp end of suicide statistics. How can we be surprised when our society deliberately marginalises our rangatahi?\nWe must stop looking at our rangatahi as statistics or as problems that need solving. We must continue to work harder to connect so that we don't make things worse. In this country, we are looking around trying to find answers for the issues and the problems that face us. I believe that our rangatahi already have the answers, and I've put this in the New Zealand Herald this week. I suggest we begin to think seriously about how we connect, how we hand over the reins and allow our rangatahi to do what they do best in their generation, which is lead. We need to listen to rangatahi, to humble ourselves as p\u0101'ake and find out how we can support them and celebrate them to live as their true selves, to remove the barriers that are holding them back from realising their dreams and aspirations, to ensure they have the opportunities to connect with each other, with their culture, and with their w'akapapa.\nAnother issue we as leaders of this country, in our sphere of influence as members of Parliament, need to acknowledge is how we perpetuate the stigmatisation of our many w'anau: our young people, our takat\u0101pui, those who are in gangs, those who are on benefits. We need to do better by them. I know there are w'anau out there that are working really hard to break cycles of intergenerational trauma. W'anau: I see you, I mihi to you, I acknowledge your mana and your resilience. When this very House shamefully ridicules, bashes, and debates the rights of those w'anau, it is an assault on our identities and our lived experiences. We have a responsibility to address our own behaviour. We have an obligation to look in the mirror.\nThese are institutions and attitudes that instil w'akam\u0101 into our communities. W'akam\u0101: shame. It's one of the biggest killers of M\u0101ori: too w'akam\u0101 to ask for help, to ask for help out of addictions, to ask for help when we're p\u014dhara, to ask for help out of abuse, to ask for help when our w'anau aren't doing well. At the very least, we need to be focusing on eliminating systemic racism. We need to pour our energy into addressing barriers. We need to make sure that the resources and the wraparound support is there for communities in order to ensure our w'anau get what they need to deal with these complex issues. We must be focused on holistic wellbeing and its determinants, rather than continuing with piecemeal and uncoordinated approaches. We need to invest in each other.\nWe have a mental health crisis in this country, and we cannot sit idly by while so many of our people are suffering from despair and hopelessness. There is no excuse to allow for the poverty, the inequities, the racism, the judging, the profiling that is making our people think there is no hope, that they are less than. We must do better, and I believe, united, we can. I have strong tautoko, as an individual, as an MP, as Te Paati M\u0101ori, to continue to support long-term, cross-party efforts to address. I ask that we all, within our sphere of influence as w'anau, as w'anaunga, as leaders, as participants in community, we lift up: we lift up the trauma that is falling on our communities, on our rangatahi, on our t\u0101ne, and we help them to breathe.\nN\u014d reira,"

      "text": "Every suicide is one too many, and suicide is far too common in our community here in New Zealand. That means that almost every New Zealander has lost someone dear to them to suicide. I certainly have, and I'm grateful to parliamentary colleagues who have done the hard work to put together the Zero Suicide Aotearoa report to advance our conversation on this very important topic. I've taken time to read the report, ahead of this debate, and I want to congratulate the members of the working group who have put it together. It speaks well to all the efforts and the seriousness with which the topic deserves, and with which you've engaged on it.\nI was taken by page 10, and it really presents quite a novel concept around zero suicide, that zero suicide should be an organising goal for our response to suicide. It is a quality improvement and safety approach, and it means that we will look in a holistic way at what is a very complicated problem. It focuses us on what we can do to prevent suicide. When I came to Parliament, I spoke about how preventative health was my passion that motivated me in health, and now in my work here. It still is, but what a challenging problem to prevent suicide is. There's no screening test, no vaccine, the medicines are difficult, but it is not at all a hopeless situation. What this report shows is the very practical ways in which we can organise ourselves to do much better.\nInterventions in health need to follow a causal model\u2014we need to know what's wrong in order to fix it. On page 13 the group sets out a causal model. If you look at it, you'll see how complicated it is. Risk factors for suicide can be found in health systems, where there are barriers to accessing care; in society; in our community, if that's affected by trauma, discrimination, war, or conflict; in our relationships; and also at an individual level. Yes, mental health problems are listed, but also drug and alcohol problems, jobs, financial losses, chronic pain, and others. I commend the committee on presenting this issue with the true complexity that it really has. In acknowledging that complexity, it means we have to recognise that our interventions will be multifactorial. These, too, are listed in the report. It includes, yes, mental health policies, but also addressing some of these wider priorities: alcohol, how we organise the health system, the response of the media to suicides. Now, the Government's response on these issues is included in our work under He Ara Oranga, and we also have a suicide prevention strategy and implementation plan. It touches on areas of leadership, knowledge, workforce, evaluation, and monitoring, and work on that is under way. In our Suicide Prevention Office, we work on engagement, and in particular a great deal of work has been done in order to engage with people with lived experience and M\u0101ori. A review of scientific literature in this complex field of suicide prevention is under way, and the terms of reference for a review of the process for investigating deaths by suicide is also being undertaken. We should not shy away from the complexity of this issue that is reflected in the report, but that also means that we will be active for a long time, on multiple fronts, in order to make a difference.\nThis work occurs alongside the Government's wider work to transform the mental health system, but what I want to touch on is Government's other priorities, other work, on building an inclusive society. When I think about the friend I have lost to suicide, I know there's not any one thing I could pinpoint to answer the question, \"Why?\" But I do know that homophobia contributed to the immense pain that he felt. That's why I see this Government's wider actions on building an inclusive society as so important\u2014on conversion therapy, on decolonisation, on meeting Pacific aspirations in New Zealand, and on poverty reduction. I thank the members of the committee for their work on this report.",

I can say that at the time, I was the chair of the Health Committee, and, in so doing, I'd like to acknowledge Jenny Marcroft, who was a member of that committee; Matt Doocey, who was a member of that committee; and, in fact, Dr Reti himself.\nI'd also like to thank the mental health and addictions workforce, those of our community who specifically choose to work with people who have mental health and addiction challenges. Your work is phenomenal, we need to support you better, and this report is an effort to help all of us, collectively, understand the context within which you work.\nFor me, today provides an amazing opportunity for much hope, because our report it clear: suicide deaths are preventable. If we start from that premise, then I think the challenge for all of us is: how do we enable people to have mental health and addiction wellbeing? What do we need to do to provide us\u2014all of us\u2014with the tools to be able to mitigate the complexity of life, because suicide is, in fact, an incredibly complex phenomenon, and it occurs in all regions of the world.\nSo when I look at my own mental health wellbeing, where does that come from? For me, it comes from my whakapapa. It comes from being a member of a wh\u0101nau, of a hap\u016b, and of an iwi. It comes from my language, which is takat\u0101pui. It means I exist in my cultural framework as I am: valued, loved, nurtured, and accepted.\nSo, for me, I have a t\u016brangawaewae, and when you have a turangawaewae that is solid and that is stable, you can weather life, because life is a challenge. When you have a turangawaewae, you know that you're never alone. So the challenges of bullying and of harassment, the challenges of violence, of racism, of sexism, of homophobia\u2014which, essentially, is about power and it's, essentially, about how we distribute the opportunity that our public-good system, for example, delivers to New Zealanders. Are they equitable? Do they enable, from my perspective, every single New Zealander to create a turangawaewae that's going to enable them to lead a resilient, participative, strong life?\nSo, from my perspective, what this report actually does is it consolidates all the best practice around the world, and I have to acknowledge Phillipa Gaines. I think she did a phenomenal job, because, in fact, there were a lot of discussions about what this report could do, should do, would do, but in the end, I think the title speaks for itself. Again, that is that every suicide is preventable, and if you have a national strategy, then you're on a pathway to fulfilling the specific needs of different communities.\nI particularly want to take the opportunity\u2014even though tomorrow is the 35th anniversary of homosexual law reform in our LGBT community have faced such horrific discrimination, and, particularly, our trans, intersex, and non-binary people continue to do so\u2014and I would actually like to focus on MATES in Construction. Construction is an area where there's a lot of stress, and, obviously, men are employed in the construction sector. There's an initiative called MATES in Construction, which actually has empowered mates\u2014men\u2014working on construction sites to disclose that they're having challenges, that they're stressed, and that they have relationship issues and financial issues, and, for me, that is at the heart of the solution to the issue. It has to be based in the communities that have the concerns about suicide, and I want to commend that initiative because it's providing the platform\u2014",

As I was purviewing the statistics\u2014and some of them are absolutely heartbreaking\u2014I was putting faces to those statistics. In fact, as a brand new member of this House in my first year, I lost a young niece, just starting out in her life, to whakamomori\u2014a young, beautiful wahine M\u0101ori; a young, beautiful woman, 18 years old, passionate about her culture, a love for our reo, a strong wh\u0101nau unit. I remember at that tangihanga, we all held each other and we cursed ourselves for not doing enough. We cursed ourselves for not seeing the signs.\nI want to acknowledge the work that the cross-party group has done. You've brought to the forefront, for all of us, a well-considered report that builds on the commissioned work that has resulted in this Zero Suicide Aotearoa report.

I want to highlight the work of Rural Women trust for bringing to the forefront the conversations that were impacting, by and large\u2014and I will say it: it was young men. It was men, actually, of all ages that didn't talk about mental health, that didn't feel so comfortable, and we're noticing a shift, but there's more work to be done.\nI remember as a young person, I sat on the board for RainbowYOUTH. It was the biggest issue of our time. When we sat there, we would talk about how whakamomori was so invasive amongst our communities, and my friend here shared a personal story about our rates for takat\u0101pui are far too high when it comes to whakamomori. But the rates, of course, that break our heart\u2014that break my personal heart\u2014are those that relate to M\u0101ori. Huge amounts. It's an issue that's impacting. So the work that we're doing to prevent suicide\u2014and whilst there may not be unanimous support across the House for a zero target, there is a lot of work that has been done that has been taken from that report. I want to highlight the fact that we have set up the Suicide Prevention Office. We're implementing the recommendations, where it makes sense to, for He Ara Oranga. We've directed the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health with\u2014",

      "text": "Kia ora koutou. Firstly,\nThank you so much to the Cross-Party Mental Health and Addictions Wellbeing Group, because any work that puts a highlight on this kaupapa is critical, and especially in this place where we get to make the big decisions. And I want to note the importance of saying something like \"zero suicide\" is critical, because what gets measured improves. If we don't set targets\u2014if we don't hold ourselves accountable to something\u2014nothing much ever changes.\nI've always thought that the value of a national framework is that we can look at the national issues which impact. We can look at the systemic issues that impact on M\u0101ori, in terms of that fact that we live in a colonial-settler country, because these statistics, of course, are reflected across the world for indigenous people. My own work in suicide prevention, my work, my research, production of suicide prevention resources specifically for Takat\u0101pui, done in collaboration with the Mental Health Foundation and with RainbowYOUTH, all of that has been in order to have that simple thing that we would hope: that our young people will grow old. That is an incredibly low bar to start from.\nSuicide Prevention Strategy, it stills takes an individualised approach to how we will work our solutions. It talks about saying how important it is to have Te Au M\u0101ori approach. It does not, however, incorporate any of those approaches in its report and how things will be done. That's left to M\u0101ori providers, and it's left to wh\u0101nau. And in our rainbow communities it's left to kids in peer support groups in schools throughout this country looking after each other, because when some of our young people are struggling they tell their mates. Our wh\u0101nau are often the last to know.\nSo in this declaration, now this was produced and led by the work of T\u0101 Mason Durie and legendary M\u0101ori suicide prevention workers Michael Naera and Dr Keri Lawson-Te Aho. And I was privileged to speak at this, it was the Turamarama ki te Ora World Indigenous Suicide Prevention Conference in Rotorua in 2016. Unfortunately, the things that are spoken about here have not significantly changed. The key thing about this, is it makes it very, very clear, we don't need to just change our mental health system to make a dent in these suicide numbers. We don't need to just change our health system, we need to change the whole of society.\nSo number one, \"We weep for the increasing number of our people whose lives have been cut short by suicide\"; \"We respect the courage and fortitude of families and friends who have endured unexpected and often inexplicable losses of dear ones\"; \"We commit ourselves to healing our own wounds and the wounds of our lineage, and in so doing to exemplify the ways in which light can be brought into the world, inhabited by our elders, our peers, and our young people\"; \"We declare that all our people should be able to 'live well' into old age\"; \"We believe that the will to 'live well' is strong when the human mauri is strong; 'living well' means being able to live as M\u0101ori, as indigenous peoples, and as citizens of the world\"; \"We will strive to build safe and nurturing communities that generate confidence, integrity, inclusion, equity, and goodwill\"; \"We recognise the key roles that wh\u0101nau and families play in strengthening the mauri by transferring knowledge, culture, language, values, and love to their children and grandchildren\"; \"We endorse the benefits of tikanga, kawa, healing, and other cultural protocols to lift the spirit and strengthen our people in schools, health centres, sporting clubs, social media, the workplace, and the streets\"; \"We expect health, education, and all social service providers to offer services that are accessible, timely, and effective for indigenous peoples\";\u2014the last one I will read\u2014\"We challenge national and local authorities and city councils to adopt and enforce regulations to reduce the availability of alcohol and other harmful substances; to ensure that homes are warm, comfortable, and affordable; to insist that streets, workplaces, schools, and the internet are all safe places for our peoples; and to combat practices that diminish self-worth and hope.\"\nThank you for this report. Thank you everybody who's given part of this k\u014drero and all of those who do the hard work out there.\n[Authorised  te reo text to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]\n[Authorised translation to be inserted by the Hansard Office.]",

It's also what our suicide prevention strategy is called. We're here, as Minister Little said in his contribution, because this is an important conversation to have; it's also a difficult conversation to have. I echo what other members in this House have said before me: that this is an issue that touches, has touched, many of us in this House and beyond, and I dedicate my contribution to those we have lost through suicide, people in my family and friends, and beyond that, across Aotearoa and beyond. It is a global issue that faces all of us.\nI also just want to echo a comment that was made previously as we consider the stats. We know that the statistics are unacceptable in Aotearoa. We know that our suicide numbers are very high, but I want us also to keep in mind and hold at the heart of our debate here today that we're not just talking about numbers; that we're talking about people, who were valued, who were cherished, and who were loved by their wh\u0101nau and their communities.\nI speak as the member of Parliament for Maungakiekie, where this is an issue that is raised with me time and again across my electorate. I also speak as the Minister for Youth, because the evidence tells us that some groups are at higher risk of dying by suicide, and we know that this is something that affects our young people and affects them tremendously. It is raised with me in conversations that I have with our rangatahi across Aotearoa.\nWe know, also\u2014we keep at the heart of our debate here\u2014that, when we talk about suicide, suicide is complex, that identities are complex, that life is complex. But we also hold on to what we know: that suicide is preventable. And I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the Zero Suicide Aotearoa report, the cross-party group that commissioned the report, and the various organisations that have put their time and effort into reviewing what is in this report and what it tells us. I mihi to you all and those who have spent many years working with those with suicidal ideation but also wh\u0101nau who have lost loved ones, and I thank you for your work at this point.\nI think one thing that we agree with across the House here is that the time has passed for us to raise awareness about this issue; the time has come for action. And that's why we have a Suicide Prevention Office that was established in 2019. That is why we have a suicide prevention strategy and an action plan that guides the approach that we take and the actions that we take to address this issue.\nI also want to acknowledge the Suicide Prevention Office, and particularly also pay tribute to the director, Carla na Nagara, because I've had conversations with her and I know that the approach that they take is that one size doesn't fit all. I know that they're aware that the trends also show, and it's laid out in this report, that while there are specific groups that are more at risk of suicide and suicidal ideation\u2014that, for example, the trend shows that it is increasing in some other groups, like our Asian communities as well. I know there's been a concerted effort to go out there and understand what puts people at risk, so that we can take the steps that are relevant to them, with them, to address the issue. And I thank those involved in that, as well.\nFinally, I'll make the point that, while steps are being taken on this side of the House to ensure that people have the mental health and wellbeing support when they need it, earlier on, in a way that is culturally relevant and appropriate, that is safe, and in a way that breaks the stigma that often is held around these issues, we are also taking steps to change the landscape that often contributes and addressing things like the long-term challenges that face us: the housing crisis, support for those without jobs who can't work because of a health condition or a disability, lifting wages, creating jobs, addressing family and sexual violence, addressing racism and discrimination, ensuring that we strengthen social cohesion across Aotearoa so that everyone can feel safe, valued, heard, have a sense of belonging\u2014",

      "text": "Thank you, Mr Speaker. It has been widely accepted it takes many sectors and groups to save lives. In the year ended 2019, we lost almost double the number of people to suicide compared with deaths from motor vehicle accidents: 685 people took their lives, in the year ended 2019. Of the one per 150,000 people that contemplated suicide, I was one of them. I was medicated for three years because of it. Thankfully, as a young man, when I was really struggling, I had the support of family and friends to cope when so many didn't. I was that guy in my 30s. I was the guy that struggled terribly. The harder I worked, the less I achieved and the less in control of my life I felt. I was the normal guy that would do that 110 hours a week just to get something done so I felt significant, so that I felt I was still the farmer.\nThe nature of farming is often physically very onerous. I remember a period in my earlier career where in nine years I took no longer than five days off in a row. This wasn't heroics; it's what I wanted to do. It's how I identified with who I was. Because like so many farmers, I believed in a dream that I was doing and the journey I desperately wanted to see the success of and achievements in.\nMany here in this Chamber may think they understand farmers; respectfully, many don't. Rural families invest, in many cases, their entire lives. For many families, rural families and country life is all they know. Mental illness is an absolute scourge in rural communities. Farmers bear huge burdens, massive hours, long periods of isolation. We contend with crop failures to floods routinely and more increasingly, and poor public policy that's becoming increasingly impractical and unworkable. Rural mental health is often attached to well-intentioned politicians, and this hall is full of them, but they lack the consequences of their policies and their ideas in real time. This often exacerbates our lack of self-worth.\nIn 32 years, I have seen it all. I have seen drug use run amok and depression. I have also buried four of my farming colleagues. Rural folk often and in hushed tones refer to it as the black dog or the hitchhiker or the bloody thief in the night. Farmers and rural folk are often pragmatists and we tend to treat mental illness like broken bones or the flu. But in truth, it's very different. Ultimately, we know we can't put time frames on these things. Sadly, the help we often want or need just simply isn't coming. There are good people, these were us, they were our people, and they are Kiwis.\nFarmers identify who they are by what they do; ever increasingly, this is being taken from them. My Mycoplasma bovis case recently is a prime example. Everyone, while well-intentioned in the Rural Support Trust\u2014I received one phone call in a year. We all hear the Minister of Health routinely saying this kind of thing is not simply good enough. Well, we say in rural New Zealand, \"What's he doing about it, and when will they all start working together?\" Where are our doctors, our healthcare workers? When will rural clinics get the bloody help they need that all too often they don't have?\nI am no exception in rural New Zealand. My experiences are commonplace. Rural mental health and support is often fleeting and sporadic. Rural men are more than twice as often likely to commit suicide than their urban counterparts. This is an endemic problem across our regions. This absolutely has to change, and with a Government that has signalled significant\u2014",

      "text": "Thank you, Mr Speaker. I'd like to start just by acknowledging the Cross-Party Mental Health and Addictions Wellbeing Group, whose work has led to the report that we're debating today, and in particular some of the founding members that have spoken in the debate, including Matt Doocey, Louisa Wall, Chl\u00f6e Swarbrick, and also Jenny Marcroft, the former member, who is with us today. I'd like to also acknowledge all of those whose lives have been affected by suicide, but also acknowledge those who are working in the community at the moment to look after those who are in distress, so whether it be friends, wh\u0101nau, those working in the community or our mental health services.\nI think our suicide rates, as we've heard today, are unacceptably high, and this report, along with Every Life Matters, which is our country's suicide prevention strategy and action plan, signals that every life does matter and that all of us have a role to play in working towards a future where there is no suicide. But I think, thinking about how we achieve this, the factors that are underpinning our country's high suicide rates are complex, and action across all of society is going to be required.\nI think, looking back in terms of the work I've been involved with in public health and thinking of the success of some of the other initiatives that have tried to grapple with complex issues\u2014things like sudden unexpected infant death syndrome and a large number of preventable deaths from road traffic accidents\u2014and thinking about what some of those key elements were that led to their success, a lot of the issues are still with us, but what we've seen is reductions over many years. I think one of the key elements is leadership, making sure that we've got that leadership at the top\u2014and that's not only at the political level.\nI think what we've seen today in terms of the level of cross-party support for suicide prevention suggests that we do have that commitment across this Parliament but, I think, also at the operational level, because when we need to work together across sectors to address these issues, we need that leadership coming for the coordination from the top. But I think we also need a plan, and that plan needs to not only be evidence-based and based on research but also based on drawing on the knowledge of those with lived experience and having them contribute to the way forward. I think we also need a strong, resilient workforce and to think about making sure we've got a workforce and people positioned to provide support in the community, in our GP practices, across hospitals and specialist services\u2014making sure we've got the workforce there.\nI think we also need to address the broader determinants of health. That's not only just reducing the huge impact our financial stress and other stresses have on people but also making sure that people are resilient and they're connected within their community. That means, for example, young people having training and opportunities. It means families being able to have enough money so their children can go to school camp and they can participate in sport. It means people turning up to work and having a safe workplace and knowing that when they want to work hard, they can get ahead. It also means having access to quality housing.\nSo there's a lot of things underpinning that, and I think the thing is: where have we got to so far? I think, just talking about some of the things we have put in place\u2014so in terms of leadership, I'm pleased to see the cross-party support we've got here in our Parliament today but also, thinking through at the operational level, the Suicide Prevention Office, which was established and has been working since 2019 to coordinate all of the suicide prevention work across the sector, and also thinking about our Every Life Matters, which is the suicide prevention strategy and action plan, and thinking through how that charts the blueprint for action across the sectors as we move forward. But I also think it's about workforce development, because it's really important that we've got that skilled workforce there to deliver the support we need.\nSo, basically, in our region, we've seen, and many people have been benefiting from, these new health improvement practitioners that are based in primary care to provide support for people, and also expansions in terms of youth counselling, and ongoing support as well in terms of telehealth services\u2014that's extra funding into Youthline and also Need to Talk? 1737. So there's a lot of things that we need to do, but I'd just like to acknowledge that I'm pleased to be part of a Parliament that's happy to step up and say we're happy to work together. We're happy. There's much more to be done, but we're moving forward to make sure that we've got a country where we've got a future free of suicide. Thank you.",

      "text": "Thank you, Mr Speaker. It's an honour to speak today. To those that we've lost and to those who are currently suffering, this is a big moment for Parliament, and I want to congratulate the cross-party group. The onus is now on the rest of us to back them and make sure that this is a truly apolitical forum going forward. There is no room for politics in mental health.\nEveryone has a story. Every family has a story. And I think, when you first experience it, it doesn't ever happen in one's own family\u2014and excuse me for saying \"your\", Mr Speaker, but this is just one of those conversations\u2014it never happens in your family until it does. In 1995, my sister lost her husband, and we were left with two young nephews, one of whom is about to become a dad. Until it happens in your own family, it's something that's over there and it's often not talked about. When I was growing up, it was never talked about. Young people died and no one ever knew why they died. But I think every family in this day and age has been touched in some way, if not by suicide, at least by mental health.\nI want to especially thank Matt and the cross-party team, who worked hard with a focus towards rural mental health. Mark Cameron's just covered some of that off so well, and thank you Mark for that, because my brother-in-law, Steve, was a farmer, and it can be lonely. A lot of our community groups are doing some fantastic work. I want to make mention of the Rural Support Trust, Neil Bateup and the team, who are out in our rural communities. Sometimes I have to ask the Rural Support Trust people if they're OK, because they're dealing with some pretty heavy issues. It's wonderful in our communities to have the John Kirwan's and the Mike King's and people like that who lead the way on these topics, and the Lance Burdett's, but to support all of those people, and I really thank those people for the work they've done. We all need to get behind them, because in every community there are people who are helping the mental health situation. Most of us don't know what to do often, and it's the Rural Support Trust and others who help us get behind those of us who are suffering.\nNow, Matt Doocey mentioned before that we'd had this two-pager yesterday from the Mental Health Foundation talking about the language, as politicians, that we use. But I would ask every politician in this House to consider the language we use every day when politicians talk about farmers. And I often find myself saying, \"Farmers are people too.\" As we go through our environmental issues and all of the other issues that we're trying to deal with, people are working so hard, and the language that is used towards farmers sometimes is so tough and they feel like everything's coming at them, and, no matter what they do, it's never enough. So I would ask us all not just to watch our language around zero suicide, but to please watch the language that we use when we're talking about not just farmers but every group in the community.\nI am currently proud to be working with my son Tony and Fonterra on a new initiative called \"Supporting Farmers\", and, in particular, supporting sharemilkers around power imbalances, bullying, those types of things. Now, we got here through an experience where the help that Tony asked for was not forthcoming. And so I want to say that we're really proud of Tony, we're really proud that Tony is still with us, and we're really proud that Tony's going to be using his experience to help other young men and other sharemilkers as they step forward in their farming careers. And I want to thank Fonterra for taking us on in that initiative. So really today, I think, is a momentous occasion. I stood on a stage with Matt Doocey, Jenny Marcroft, and Louisa Wall when we did a cross-party mental health thing with an Australasian forum, and I saw the camaraderie that was in that group on that day, and tears were shed, and we're all humans at the end of the day. I want us all to get behind this cross-party group and make the most of this initiative that's been launched by this team. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",

I am pleased to follow on from Barbara Kuriger. She is up there with those that I respect the most in this House because of our shared commitment to rural communities. We may have different ideas, but our values and our drive to ensure sustainable rural communities, and wellbeing within that, is the same, and I genuinely believe that across the House, on the whole, that is the case. And this, today, should encourage us all, because today's debate has demonstrated to the people of New Zealand that actually, this Parliament is committed to working together. We work together all the time, but sadly the public doesn't see that. But on this issue, we have come together, and I hope that this is a watershed moment, and that this House will continue to work together. As Barbara Kuriger said, there is no room for politics in mental health, so let today be the moment that we collectively commit to putting politics aside and finding solutions that work for everyone in this country.\nNo family is spared from the impact of mental health. No one in this country can say that they have escaped its horrid impact. That is certainly the case for my family, with close family members having committed suicide, and if it weren't for the support and intervention of our health service, there would have been more. I remember as a youngster hearing conversations about elderly family members and their \"nerves\". Other members may have heard similar conversations: \"Great-auntie can't come out tonight because her nerves are at her.\" How good is it, that as a country, particularly in rural areas, we have moved away in so many ways\u2014not enough, but we've made progress in actually acknowledging that this is an issue and it is something that we should talk about. In my grandfather's generation, people that had mental health were \"queer bastards\" or \"silly buggers\" or \"funny buggers\". That attitude helps no one. Now when I go on programmes like The Country, Jamie Mackay and Rowena Duncum dedicate so much time on that radio show to raising awareness and talking about mental health issues in rural communities, it empowers people to come forward. It empowers them to talk to their mates.\nBut there are fundamental issues that we as a country need to address. In rural areas, people are isolated. The realities of farming and working on farms means that it is so much more difficult to access the help that they need. It can take so much longer. And isolation is not just geographical; isolation can be from technology as well, where those that live in larger urban centres, if they don't want to meet face to face, can contact someone through their mobile phone or the internet. Not everyone in rural communities have that, and I am encouraged by the principle that drove the policy decision from this Government to get rid of district health boards, which was that we need to eliminate the postcode lottery. It should not matter whether you live in Wellington, Auckland, P\u014drangahau, or Eket\u0101huna, you should have the same level of access to the care that you need. I hope that when these changes come in, rural communities will be at the forefront, along with all other marginalised communities.\nI want to take the opportunity, in the time that I have left, to acknowledge our first responders. For seven years before I entered this House, I was a volunteer firefighter. They are present in every single community in our country, and it is the rural volunteer firefighters that are the first responders to suicides. They are not anonymous people. They are our friends. They are our family, and attending a call like that is something that will hurt you and haunt you for the rest of your life. Our rural communities are dependent on the generosity and time of volunteers, and they don't get acknowledged enough. I'm encouraged by the collaborative approach of this debate. Long may that continue, and to those that are struggling with mental health, reach out. You are loved, you are wanted, and help is there.",
